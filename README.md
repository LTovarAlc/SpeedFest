# SpeedFest

SpeedFest is a website for an event about sport cars. The site presents content in a striking way to the user, using related images from the event.

This project, in addition to being attractive, has one of its main functionalities as the QR generator, which works to generate an "entry" for the user.

The website is developed with React, using some open source libraries like react-slick-slider, react-qr-code, animateCSS, and UIVerse.
